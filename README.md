Trying to make tiles/grid/graph maps work with a common API to get:
	- Peg spaces linked by trails, like ludo, senet etc.
	- maybe it's also useful for laying math matches puzzles (eval symbols)
	- Root (BG) like maps (node, edge, face/null)
	- Grids (regular) by fixed region/count to infinite (face, parts (edge, vertex))
